% Creating a character array
A = [0, -1, 4; 9, -14, 25; -34, 49, 64];
C = (A >= 0)


% compute the square root of only those elements of A given in the previous program that are no less than 0 and add 50 to those elements that are negative.
A = [0, -1, 4; 9, -14, 25; -34, 49, 64];
C = (A >= 0);
A(C) = sqrt(A(C))
A(~C) = A(~C) + 50
